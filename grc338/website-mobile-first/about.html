            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <h5>In 1986 Pedro’s Tacos launched the first fish taco stand in Orange County, California.  The beach town of San Clemente soon saw hungry surfers lining up for the satisfying tacos and burritos, filling themselves after long surf sessions.  Friends told friends, and soon people traveled from near and far to enjoy the delicious and craveable specialties found only at Pedro’s

Today with four locations, Pedro’s celebrates thirty years in business and continues to maintain the high quality and original flavors of the early days.  For generations, fans have known about Pedro’s quality, value and unique flavors. 

The tacos and burritos start with soft, warm tortillas filled with crispy battered cod, garlic-marinated grilled shrimp, tender seasoned chicken or marinated steak, and even chorizo and eggs for breakfast.  Fresh salsas and guacamole are made daily from scratch.  The Pedro’s Tacos experience is a genuine representation of the Southern California vibe. 

Three decades and millions of customers later, Pedro’s remains a classic.  The original fish taco stand. . .still standing!</h5>
