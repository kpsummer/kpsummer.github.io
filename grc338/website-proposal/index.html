            <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>SLO Surf Shop</p>
            
            <p>SLO Surf Shop is a store aimed to provide customers with everything they need to get out on the waves. It will be stocked with items such as new and used boards, wetsuits, board bags, etc. We will also provide board repair services. Anything that the customer may need to start their surfing journey or enhance it, SLO Surf Shop will provide it.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience will be anyone who loves surfing and the ocean. The primary tasks/goals of people who visit the site are locals in San Luis Obispo wanting to purchase geer to surf, to sell used boards, or to possibly get their board repaired. Age, surfing experience, and knowledge can range anywhere from young beginners to people who have been surfing for decades. People would visit the site to check inventory or find a way to contact SLO Surf Shop to get information about the services we provide.</p>
           
            <p>To profile the customer, I came up with a man named John and his son Jack. John is 45 years old; he has been surfing for 10 years with an 8' board and is looking to buy a board with similar volume but less length. His son, Jack, is 9 years old and is looking to try his hand at surfing. John and Jack want to be able to browse online for baords and wetsuits from the comfort of their home together before heading into the store. Then they want to come into the store with geer in mind that they know is in stock and questions to ask employees.</p>
